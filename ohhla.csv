Unload it, I hollow the tips

I'ma murder that pussy like it come from across the tracks
Might get fucked in the lot in the back

Last time that they sent me away to prison?
Top tier views of the building
The day room, the tower, and a whole gang of killers
I'm used to riding Gran Coupes, G sliding
My streets is private and the view's worth a million dollars
Is you gon' sit still while a nigga walk it off?
When they crack the gate I'm right back balling
Would you come to the visits?
If they say I murdered a nigga and they had an eyewitness?
Would you help me hide if I jumped bail?
When they ask questions bitch don't tell
Would you have another nigga driving in my car?
Take the money out the safe and then fuck it off?
I'm asking all these lil questions 'cause I gotta know
If you don't answer right, bitch you gotta go

Turn it into loyalty, name our daughter Royalty
Pay them lawyer fees if I go down
Would you hold me down, would you hold it down
Would you stay around?
Or would you switch like a snitch
Turn your back, get cold feet and jump ship
I don't need no broke bitch
I need a bitch who gon' listen
Cook dope out the pot, clean the kitchen
Don't be so promiscious
Can I trust you with my stash?
If they pop me would you secure bags?

I'm from where your favorite drug dealers might be witnesses
I'm from where some peoples caught on fire faking chemists
I'm from where they used to get the water with no fish and drip
I'm from where they treat a dead body like some fish 'n' chips
Eat your ass alive, you might get swallowed by a trinky bitch
She might look just like she is a model but got syphilis
I'm from where some bitches be more gangster than these niggas is
Half the time these killers really gay or really snitching shit
I'ma make myself a fuckin' general like [?]
Free my hitters, I could be in prison just like Ruthless is

Smoke a nigga, send him off to meet his maker

I was in LA, totin' straps with the gangsters
Ferragamo cuffs, used to be on the ankle
Free all of my niggas out the cell, give 'em [?]

Is you gon' ride and save the pussy if I do a bid?
Skinny nigga but I do it big
I'm paranoid so I keep a chopper and a SIG
If it get down and I can't get to it
Would you burn a nigga down, smoke him like a cig
I need the type that don't run from the dick
And she don't leave a drop on my fit when she swallow this shit
Unload it, I hollow the tips
Might put a hole in your wig
I'ma murder that pussy like it come from across the tracks
Might get fucked in the lot in the back
Keep it G, stay Jordan down
Projects support him now
Now you lay up, no relax
'Cause you ain't never fucked on the racks
Who put that arch in your back? 03

Is you gon' do me like them other bitches?
Last time that they sent me away to prison?
Top tier views of the building
The day room, the tower, and a whole gang of killers
I'm used to riding Gran Coupes, G sliding
My streets is private and the view's worth a million dollars
Is you gon' sit still while a nigga walk it off?
When they crack the gate I'm right back balling
Would you come to the visits?
If they say I murdered a nigga and they had an eyewitness?
Would you help me hide if I jumped bail?
When they ask questions bitch don't tell
Would you have another nigga driving in my car?
Take the money out the safe and then fuck it off?
I'm asking all these lil questions 'cause I gotta know
If you don't answer right, bitch you gotta go

If I was locked up in the county would you write me?
Can I count you to be there, support me mentally?
Fuck your sympathy, I want your energy
Turn it into loyalty, name our daughter Royalty
Pay them lawyer fees if I go down
Would you hold me down, would you hold it down
Would you stay around?
Or would you switch like a snitch
Turn your back, get cold feet and jump ship
I don't need no broke bitch
I need a bitch who gon' listen
Cook dope out the pot, clean the kitchen
Don't be so promiscious
Can I trust you with my stash?
If they pop me would you secure bags?
Would you spend my last?
If I lost all I had
Would you visit me behind the glass?

Would you hold it down, would stay around

She want to have sex with me, Greedy so my baddie sweet
All my bitches street, she need a nigga with some felonies
Hater never met me, it ain't nothin' that they tellin' me

I could never change, I ain't never been no hater
Always been one hundred, I was everything she wanted, oh
She don't want a broke boy, she need a nigga getting hundreds

I've been meditating with the money
I've been dedicated to the dollars
Got a bank and they started acting funny
I done always kept that shit one hundred

I was in LA, totin' straps with the gangsters
Ferragamo cuffs, used to be on the ankle
Free all of my niggas out the cell, give 'em [?]
Smokin' all this dope 'til my chest feelin' strangled

I got my love from my moms

If they say I murdered a nigga and they had an eyewitness?
Would you help me hide if I jumped bail?
When they ask questions bitch don't tell
Would you have another nigga driving in my car?
Take the money out the safe and then fuck it off?
I'm asking all these lil questions 'cause I gotta know
If you don't answer right, bitch you gotta go

[03 Greedo]
If I went down would you stay round?
If I went down would you stay round?

[Lil 100]
If I was locked up in the county would you write me?
Can I count you to be there, support me mentally?
Fuck your sympathy, I want your energy
Turn it into loyalty, name our daughter Royalty
Pay them lawyer fees if I go down
Would you hold me down, would you hold it down
Would you stay around?
Or would you switch like a snitch
Turn your back, get cold feet and jump ship
I don't need no broke bitch
I need a bitch who gon' listen
Cook dope out the pot, clean the kitchen
Don't be so promiscious
Can I trust you with my stash?
If they pop me would you secure bags?
Would you spend my last?
If I lost all I had
Would you visit me behind the glass?
I just have to ask, if I went down
Would you hold it down, would stay around
Would you hold me down?

Too much hype in my life
You not with the gang so I'm not tryna hear no tides

He whipped up some salmon, taste better than it look
He cookin' dog food, the type that make you woof

Are you that real, would you bop one?
Don't come around if you not one
I am too real to be short one
That's the outcome, where I'm from
Can't ride around without drums, yeah
I'm from the section where them drugs make your nose run

Had to ride behind another hearse

Prayer for my lost, prayer for my lost
Prayer for my lost, prayer for my lost
Prayer for my lost one, and you know it hurts

Lately I been losin' homies left and right
Lately I been losin' hotties left and right
Maybe 'cause I'm havin' nightmares every night
So I gotta keep a chopper by my side
Every weekend it's another homicide
'Cause they keep just catching bodies on my side
I don't wanna die
Sometimes I'm like fuck it 'cause I live a hellish life
Feel so broke 'cause ain't no money by my side
I remember Lil Money by my side
Man sometimes I wanna cry
But I'm always outside, ooh
That's why my feelings, gotta hide, ooh
I keep my chin up for my pride, ooh
And I'm screamin' free the guy
And I'm from the other side, yeah, yeah
Hearin' voices in my head
Probably the homies that just dead
Leave me alone, all my niggas gone
Leave me alone

I just had to say a prayer for my lost ones
Probably never seen me in the church
I just had to say a prayer for my lost ones
I just had to put my nigga in the dirt
I just had to say a prayer for my lost ones

Feel it in my stomach, molly might just make me vomit
Takin' acid with the shrooms, I'm tryna see my conscience
Too much hype in my life
You not with the gang so I'm not tryna hear no tides
I'm not tryna hear no sides
I can't believe you out here in these streets livin' lies

Wet up your block with a leg and an arm
With that burner we aim at your head and start perms

Funny part about it, we knew we was gon' catch him one day
And on the ground he all up shakin', holdin' on his stomach

That boy look shook every time that he look
But I ain't gotta touch him 'cause karma's a douche
My dreads done got long, this shit just was a bush
I got a boy from the block that's a cook
He whipped up some salmon, taste better than it look
He cookin' dog food, the type that make you woof

This for my daughter, listen to the shit I taught you
They don't like to see a black person win
If I go down when I end up out of town
Just understand that I just wanted to live
'Cause when you young and tryna make it where I'm from
They don't want to let you raise your own kids
Fuck what these scary peoples always talkin' 'bout
You gotta get out there and take you a risk
You done seen what I did, you done seen what I did
Street nigga, you done seen what I did
You done seen what I did, you done seen what I did
Street nigga, you done seen what I did, you done

2005 blessed me with my only child
I changed my life 'cause all her life went in and out
Since my eighteenth she been my baby so she know I'm wild
Since she been my baby so she know I'm wild
Used to visit me in jail so she could see me smile
Keep her in Jordan, she say kids be tryna take my style
So fuck it, time for Gucci, ain't think we would make it out
Can't be from Drummer Gang if your kids say you ain't around
Can't be from Drummer Gang if you ain't finna lay shit down
Ho least against us, these hoes disrespectful
I told my daughter never be like her, just run your check up
Stay by my side when I got shot, that's how I know you special
These bad ass kids are not your peers so don't go fold to pressure
This ain't 'bout tough or weak no more, this shit 'bout thinkin' better
Me and my daughter bang the hood, Jordan Downs reppers
And I got metal for a shin, still ain't no half steppin'
You know it ain't nothin' changin' but our addresses

This for my daughter, listen to the shit I taught you

Sendin' hoes pigeon toed, raisin' up the pack price
This that I was coolin', I got hot and grabbed a MAC life
If I have a flashback I fuck around and flash twice
O3 I thought we squashed it nigga, stop it, put you on ice
Niggas tryna get me pinched, tell the judge I'm innocent
I can't trust the enemy and I can't trust my fuckin' friend
I can't even trust this lil pussy nigga Benjamin
Frankly I was really only living for the listeners
Until I realized some of the wrong people listening

Bright white, dice dice, top flight, dark Sprite
You can only understand me if you really move it
White knights, white dice, now I live a white life
Dancin' on the work, do the Vanilla Ice, two brick
Ice ice ice ice, I ain't talkin' jewelry
So icy like Gucci
Soldier like I'm Juvie
Quit the baller blocking, this is not a fuckin' movie

George Gervin (iceman)
George Jung (cash man)
Presidential George Bush, George of the Jungle
Ice man back when he was hurt he grabbed the ice pack
Ice pick, when you roll with this you need a few sticks
Ice checks, coolin' like a cooler 'cause my ice wet
Playing police roles like Ice T, and I got the Ice Cube
Big snake, cold world, life cool
I been breakin' out in people's faces what that ice do
High school, damn you was the man way back in high school
I just bought some shit I can't pronounce 'cause it was ice blue
Ice fool, ice fool, bitch I got them ice jewels
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, don't make me ice you
Icy nigga, icy licker, I just had a cold stripper
And she brought her wifey with her, and I think they real sisters
Icy body when I lick her, savage so I never kiss her
Fuck it I'm a nasty nigga

Bright white, dice dice, top flight, dark Sprite
You can only understand me if you really move it

Swing to Vegas for the big guns
Bullets lookin' size of cold waters
Got the forty for me ese
Keep a fifty in his old chopper
We ain't playin' when we hit the court
We be ballin' like them Globetrotters
Hoes be playin', never fucked a nigga
When a nigga had them broke pockets
All these presidents up in my jeans
They all dead, I call them ghost pockets
We got weapons like the Ghostbusters
I won't go out if it's no problem
Little homies with the gotti thirst
Nike store, we boostin' Foamposites
Triple ounce, they eatin' healthy cake

If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star, I just had it too hard

I couldn't stop the xan before I had money
I been dressin' like this way before they fuckin' loved me
Feel it in my stomach, molly might just make me vomit
Takin' acid with the shrooms, I'm tryna see my conscience
Too much hype in my life
You not with the gang so I'm not tryna hear no tides
I'm not tryna hear no sides
I can't believe you out here in these streets livin' lies
You really think that you tough
Callin' his bluff but we really be loadin' them nines
They DM'ed me at 8: 05
Put it on me, had that boy gone like 8: 59 (on me)
You can feel it in your spine
Everybody pointin' at you 'cause you are not right
We gonna take ten of yours if you ever try take one of mines
Wasn't for me, then you would've been died

They said crack kills but my boys sellin' hard
They say last bitch test the work went to Mars
She suck my dick for ten bucks with no arms
That was back when times was hard
That was back before I had these millions that I earned
Wet up your block with a leg and an arm
With that burner we aim at your head and start perms
Keep that shit one hundred, boy you keep it twenty
We just caught an opp, we thought that shit was funny
Funny part about it, we knew we was gon' catch him one day
And on the ground he all up shakin', holdin' on his stomach
Man fuck all them looks
I had to go get that bread so I could put money on them books
That boy look shook every time that he look
But I ain't gotta touch him 'cause karma's a douche
My dreads done got long, this shit just was a bush
I got a boy from the block that's a cook
He whipped up some salmon, taste better than it look
He cookin' dog food, the type that make you woof
You try to take this shit, I'll get you tooked

Ninety thousand dollars, that's just for one of my hooks
Please do not compare me to none of these crooks

Floatin' 'cross these motherfuckin' hits, just had an out of body
God Level nigga, I bailed out in '16

You lil bitch ass niggas steady speaking up on the low
If these project walls could talk
They'll be just like 03, you dig?
03

If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star and I had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

I remember robbin' Pisas every other Friday
I remember money house, I'm selling out of molly
I remember in Atlanta talking pounds at Follies
I remember laying down bullets in my body
If you know you finna fold then get the fuck from by me
If you ain't finna hold it down then you can't be my crimey
Greedy get the guap and play the game but keep it grimey
I've been shot by who I love and told on by my family
I've been double crossed and bird fed
One time they sucker punched a nigga
Yeah they knocked me out like Ronda Rousey
Blindside you with this bullet if you come around me
Seen you at this party, was gon' hit you, you was fucking outie

If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star and I had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

Sim-simmer, who got the keys to the Beamer?
Who put that lean in two liters?
Dreadlocks like Beanie Man, I'ma red beam you
Hit your white whip up, you know I'm gon' cream you
Act in Lime-A-Rito's, it's no Lime-A-Rita
Really sell killos and plugged in with migos
My dog Dark Jack, he stretch just like a regal
We get thumbs up when we ride past your people

If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard
In this game play your cards right or get left to starve
My mama made me a star and I had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend
If these walls could spit bars, all of they songs be this hard

My mama made me a star and I had it too hard
Bitch I came from the tar but I got high again
I'm thanking God, could have died in the pen
You haven't been 'gainst the odds like I been
You haven't been where I been, I never fold, never bend

And we do it for Lil Money, yeah
Long live Lil Money, oh
Money changes everything
I could never give a bitch a wedding ring, ooh, yeah
Rest in peace to all my niggas

She say that she nasty, told her show me what you really got
She say that she nasty, told her show me what you really got
Back when I was in the pen, I was dreamin' of the Benz
Ridin' shit without the rims, I'm booted up with all the timbs

All this money make you lose your friends

Shake a nigga, if he can't handle y'all lil break-up
Paid up, pay him for your nails your rent and makeup
Lyin' down, tell lil partner he can check this game out
Charge a bitch, then I gave her gifts and then she came out, whoa
She got played out
So that bitch just couldn't stay 'round
Treat that brain like a playground
Run her blood pressure up so she stay down
Local winner, hi hater when I came down
Now she hate it when I came 'round

I been sleeping with your girlfriend, same time you're doing time

Run for my life, run for your life
Run it up with your wife, might fuck tonight
Can't trust that bitch, so don't trust that bitch
Can't trust that bitch, nigga don't trust that bitch

I don't usually fuck these nigga bitches, I'm a player
But this hottie way too thick and her lil man a hater
Just for these hoes these niggas risk they life to get the paper
Just for the dough, I think I need a Lincoln Navigator
Take them back to bald fades with the activator
It's been some time since I had some shine
But I been back on my grind and she been back on my mind
Just like a distant reminder in the back of her mind
I put that arch in her spine, now I got her shaking
Body language, bold statement, capping is my occupation conversation rule the nation, talk her out her pink sweatsuit
So fast, she make Amber Rose look like she got no ass

I been sleeping with your girlfriend, same time you're doing time
I been on the other end, I had to change my life
Run for my life, run for your life
Run it up with your wife, might fuck tonight

Everytime you make a run for your bitch
I pull up and make her run from that dick
Run it up when she finds all my strips
We don't run all our lips, go'n and run for some shit
I can't give up locations, no information
You know we don't say shit 'cause we fighting cases for real
Fuck it got saved by a deal, you never felt how it feels
Your money counterfeit, my money real
You might go down and it's all up from here
I was depressed off them drugs and realized I'm the plug
I got blinded by love and that shit fucked me up
And that's all that I fear, all that I fear
Bitch it's my year, bitch it's my year
Love is all that I fear

I been sleeping with your girlfriend, same time you're doing time
I been on the other end, I had to change my life
Run for my life, run for your life

Grippin' on your waist
Switch positions in the wraith
Ride a nigga, switch lanes

Grippin' on your waist
Switch positions in the wraith
Ride a nigga, switch lanes
Ridin' dirty, stay safe
I keep a pistol for safety
(Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous, lil nigga stay dangerous)
Stay dangerous

Keep that shit off of safety

Keep a thirty shot clip, stay dangerous
RIP to SB from Raymond
Like cuz I'm blessed and famous
Lil cuzzo was a real gangbanger, face tats tryna cover the pain up
Off drugs and anger, used to trade our bangers
East side to the west, we was always hangin'
And I'm going up now but my life been changing
My lil hottie say I'm workin' just like Jamaican
You don't know who raised me, I'm a grape, you a raisin
Burnt out and turned down and you always hatin'
Doin' numbers, countin' green like I'm caught in the matrix
Laid back like Neo but ho I'm still crazy
I'm the one, 03 got the streets in flames
Couldn't be no lame
Since I pop it keep a popper on and aim for a hater
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I got a good luck for pager

Grippin' on your waist
Switch positions in the wraith
Ride a nigga, switch lanes
Ridin' dirty, stay safe

Niggas ain't gang gang gang, they can't hang with us

We been out here totin' Glocks on Naomi Street
Free the real, hmm, and keep the fake
The gunman should probably be home in about May
Pop the weasel for niggas thinkin' they Debo
You niggas gon' need ten honk to drive my ego
Swervin' and swervin', switchin' lanes up on the speed bump
Post still drippin' hot sauce like TapatÃ­o
Politics, hmm, just like my fashion nigga
I been did the jeans with the wings, that shit is regular
Your mans don't got over ten, you don't compare to us
Bitch all in her feelings 'cause I don't care enough
You better keep a forty for safety 'cause shit get dangerous
These niggas all in they feelings 'cause ain't no taming us, the Plug

Zip a nigga up in plastic
I'm the nigga goin' up, a nigga savage
It's a gift, it's a curse, it's a gift, it's a curse
Nah nigga I ain't average
I'm the nigga goin' up, I'm a savage

Put a spell on that bitch in my verse, that's a whole quote
Chop a bitch off where the hoes go
Blood money on my neck, bitch I made it rose gold
All my peoples Pasadena like the Rose Bowl
More gas than my teachers off a whole flow
Watered down, from the bleachers to the end zone
Cheerleaders smoke dope, kickin' shit, no clothes
You see LA, I just run out, wonder where her clothes go?
Do it behind closed doors, sippin' lean, I won't dose
New sweater made by junkie made by Kezno in my Benzo
Get her on her ass like a movie that's suspenseful
Ten tre day, I'm soldiered down like ten-four
Long live King Yella, free my nigga TK
Fuck her in that prison with the damus and keyways
Or up in the dub from the arm to the peach cake
Peter-rollin' rollin', I ain't never been a cheapskate

I know voodoo, I know magic (voodoo)
Pull up on me it get tragic
Pullin' up, I lay 'em down in the past nigga
Zip a nigga up in plastic
